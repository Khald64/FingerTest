This java program tells you your typing speed 'Words per Minute', it calculates the time you take to type in a certain number of words and then it tells you how much is your ‘WPM’. Those words are not 100% randomly generated. In fact, there is a file containing a large amount of correct English words and the program picks up words randomly from that file.

The typing speed may not be 100% accurate because I am using an algorithm that I have created all by myself. Therefore, if you tested your speed with another typing speed algorithm it may not be the same.

Right now, there is not much to do with this program than testing typing speed but in the future, there sure will be updates to fix some bugs and improve the typing speed algorithm.
